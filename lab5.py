the program will translate a sentence that is given via user input
we need to read the data of the .txt file
from that data we create a laist of strings 
use that list of strings to create a dictionary
close the file

we make a translate function that works by splitting the user input into a list of strings.

once we have a list of strings, we loop through each word in the list and check it against the dictionary to see if it exists as a words that can be 
translated

replace the list items with the translated words and print the entire thing back to the user.
